# M-Schema: a semi-structure representation of database schema
## Introduction
MSchema is a semi-structured schema representation of database structure, which could be used in various scenarios such as Text-to-SQL.
This repository contains the code for connecting to the database and constructing M-Schema.
We support a variety of relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.

【Schema】
# Table: rulings
[
(id:INTEGER, unique id identifying this ruling, Primary Key, Examples: [1, 2, 3]),
(date:DATE, date, Examples: [2007-07-15]),
(text:TEXT, description about this ruling),

]
# Table: cards

(availability:TEXT, A list of the card's available printing types., Examples: [mtgo,paper, paper, arena]),
(borderColor:TEXT, The color of the card border., Examples: [black, white, borderless]),
(edhrecRank:INTEGER, The card rank on EDHRec, Examples: [15650, 12702, 11081]),
(faceConvertedManaCost:REAL, The converted mana cost or mana value for the face for either half or part of the card., Examples: [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]),
(faceName:TEXT, The name on the face of the card., Examples: [Dusk, Dawn, Commit]),
(uuid:TEXT, The universal unique identifier (v5) generated by MTGJSON. Each entry is unique., Examples: [00010d56-fe38-5e35-8aed-518019aa36a5])

## Requirements
+ python >= 3.9
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Quick Start
You can just connect to the database using [```sqlalchemy```](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and construct M-Schema representation.

1、create a database connection.

Take PostgreSQL as an example:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
db_name = 'mydatabase'
db_engine = create_engine(f"postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/{db_name}")
```

2、construct M-Schema representation.

```python
from m_schema.schema_engine import SchemaEngine

schema_engine = SchemaEngine(engine=db_engine, db_name=db_name)
mschema = schema_engine.mschema
print(mschema.to_mschema())
mschema.save(f'./{db_name}.json')
```
